        <p id="spotify-des">i enjoy listening to music as i believe that it's an art form we can enjoy at any and all
            times, whether we're
            streaming it, creating it, or humming it. i make playlists every month so i can look back and see what kind
            of
            state of mind i was in when i listen in 5, 10, or 20 years from now.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/tennnyennnn/a-dream/">this</a> is my pinterest board of things I find
            dreamy! ✧₊⁺
        </h2>
        <p id="pinterest-des">pinterest is my favorite form of social media. i spend a lot of time scrolling through
            pretty pictures, short form
            videos, and then organizing the ones i saved (pinned) and collaborating on boards with friends. i enjoy
            nature,pretty food, and mysteriously yearning LOL.</p>
