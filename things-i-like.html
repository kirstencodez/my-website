            <h3><emp>what is the meaning of life?</emp></h3>
            <p> there are many interpretations of what life is and can be.
                there are people who believe we are here because a divine being 
                created us, the landscape, oceans, other living creatures, and the entire universe.
                others believe that we evolved from microbes millions of years ago and were cursed with 
                consciousness. there also those of us believe that life is pointless and that
                when the time comes for us to pass, there is nothing waiting for us. in my 
                opinion, i believe that we should not be too caught up on what life could be or is not. 
                i stand with the belief that life is what you make it, and i will continue to 
                live life that way because there is no other statement truer than that.
                life was created from a higher being. life is from microbes that spawned millions of years ago.
                life is pointless! life is everything all at once, isn't it wonderful?

        <p id="spotify-des">i enjoy listening to music as i believe that it's an art form we can enjoy at any and all
            times, whether we're
            streaming it, creating it, or humming it. i make playlists every month so i can look back and see what kind
            of
            state of mind i was in when i listen in 5, 10, or 20 years from now.</p>

        <p id="pinterest-des">pinterest is my favorite form of social media. i spend a lot of time scrolling through
            pretty pictures, short form
            videos, and then organizing the ones i saved (pinned) and collaborating on boards with friends. i enjoy
            nature,pretty food, and mysteriously yearning LOL.</p>
