                    growing up in a military family meant i never got to stay anywhere for too long,
                    so friends were always coming and going. i never realized
                    how important it was to maintain friendships until i met my best friend,
                    keeley. we've travelled to japan and korea together, and have been friends since
                    the eighth grade.

                <h3>concerts !</h3>
                <p>man, when am i NOT going to a concert? this year i've
                    been to three so far, but from this point until the
                    end of the year, i have five more concerts to go to!
                    i love all kinds of music, but kpop really caught me by surprise.
                    the three concerts i went to this year were all kpop concerts.

                <h3>travelling!</h3>
                <p>as previously mentioned, i grew up in a military family so i'm used to 
                    moving around all the time. i love leaving bremerton and seeing what other
                    parts of the world i have yet to touch, or have been wanting to touch again.
                    last year i went to several countries in europe, japan, and korea! 
                    i like being able to escape my responsibilities for a little while and 
                    trying new foods, meeting new people, and immersing myself in a different culture.
