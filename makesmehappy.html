                growing up in a military family meant i never got to stay anywhere for too long,
                so friends were always coming and going. i never realized
                how important it was to maintain friendships until i met my best friend,
                keeley. we've travelled to japan and korea together, and have been friends since
                the eighth grade.

            <h3>concerts !</h3>
            <p>man, when am i NOT going to a concert? this year i've
                been to three so far, but from this point until the 
                end of the year, i have five more concerts to go to!
                i love all kinds of music, but kpop really caught me by surprise.
                the three concerts i went to this year were all kpop concerts.
