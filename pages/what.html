        <h2 class="solutions"> there is <a id="LOVE">LOVE.</a></h2>
        <p>everyone has a different opinion of what love is, and that is something that makes the human species
            beautiful.
            to some, love is what you see on tv. others can disagree and say that it is dating someone.
            someone else may scrap the idea of romance altogether and say it's the way a mother looks at her newborn
            child in her arms, or that it's the sun shining through the the leaves of trees on a breezy summer
            afternoon.
            in my experience, love is all of these things. i believe that love is seen in friends who make you forget
            you're growing up.
            love is seeing your pet sleeping and then feeling warm on the inside.
            love is listening to your favorite song when you're sad. love is making and eating your favorite meal.
            love is showing up for others and yourself. love is always in your life, in ways you do not even know.
            if you are thinking about all the love you don't have anymore, think about how much of a pleasure it was to
            experience such a thing at all.
            longing for a friend, person, or something that is no longer around is normal, and it is okay. the hurt
            means at some point it was love.
            it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. it means you have lived a life worth
            living. love will always come back.</p>

        <h2 class="solutions"> there is <a id="WONDER">WONDER.</a></h2>
        <p> as we grow up, we lose our sense of child-like wonder and curiosity because we have grown accostumed to the way of the world.
            it is only once in a while people choose to venture out and reawaken that part of themselves, but what if we allowed ourselves to feel 
            that way every day? you don't have to do anything dramatic or risky, it can simply be taking a different route home and seeing a part of town 
            you aren't familiar with, or trying a new dish at a restaurant you have come to love. whatever you choose to do, 
            whatever the outcome is, in the end you have learned something new about yourself.
            a cool thing about this life is that there seems to be an infinite number of things to try, garments to wear,
            bugs to catch, cats and dogs to pet, sights to gaze in awe at, and people to meet.
            you have your entire life with yourself, why not make it exciting? like what ellie from up said, <q>adventure is out there!</q>
