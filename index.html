        <p id="hello-world">in a rapidly evolving world full of seemingly endless despair, there is wonder and beauty if you dare look
            hard enough. except, you really don't need to look hard. there is magic everywhere, even in the mundane. in
            children's laughter, a cup of coffee, in watching cars whizz by. every day we are so busy with everything we
            must do, all the deadlines we must meet, all the appointments we must catch, that we forget to slow down.
            life goes by so fast. this page is a depiction of the world through the eyes of a 20-year old college
            student, hoping to convince you there is a lot of beauty in this life. </p>
