        <h2 id="love"> there is LOVE.</h2>
        <p>everyone has a different opinion of what love is, and that is something that makes the human species beautiful. 
            to some, love is what you see on tv. others can disagree and say that it is dating someone.
            someone else may scrap the idea of romance altogether and say it's the way a mother looks at her newborn child in her arms, or that it's the sun shining through the the leaves of trees on a breezy summer afternoon.
            in my experience, love is all of these things. i believe that love is seen in friends who make you forget you're growing up. 
            love is seeing your pet sleeping and then feeling warm on the inside.
            love is listening to your favorite song when you're sad. love is making and eating your favorite meal.
            love is showing up for others and yourself. love is always in your life, in ways you do not even know. 
            if you are thinking about all the love you don't have anymore, think about how much of a pleasure it was to experience such a thing at all.
            longing for a friend, person, or something that is no longer around is normal, and it is okay. the hurt means at some point it was love.
            it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. it means you have lived a life worth living. love will always come back.</p>

            <li id="unsent-project"><a href="https://theunsentproject.com/#google_vignette" target="_blank">the unsent project</a> is a collection and archive of 
            more than 5 million unsent text messages from anonymous people to their first loves.
            however, i have also seen people use this for other romantic partners they may have had, lost friends, and 
            other people they are no longer in contact with. you can see the messages people have left,
            and if you are curious you can search your own name too. who knows, maybe someone you know or used to 
            know may have written about you. </li>

            <li id="humans-of-ny"><a href="https://www.humansofnewyork.com/" target="_blank">humans of new york</a> began <q>as a photography project in 2010. 
                the initial goal was to photograph 10,000 new yorkers on the street, and create an exhaustive catalogue of the city's inhabitants.</q>
                over the course of time, the photographers would listen to the stories their subjects would tell, and ended up including them in
                the description of their post. adding the stories of those photographed has skyrocketed the humans of new york socials.
                you can read the stories from the subjects of all different backgrounds. prepare to smile, cry, laugh, and empathize.</li>
